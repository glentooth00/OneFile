# F1 Library
More code, more problems!  
F1 is minimal, fast, and maintainable.

## One File Per Service
F1 tries to keep files and file sizes to a minimum.  
Each service is a single file (< 300 lines if possible),  
making it easy to locate, understand and use.

## Modular
Files are generally stand-alone and can be used in any project.  
Include only the files you need.
